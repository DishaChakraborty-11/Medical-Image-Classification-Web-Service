Dataset Source: Public Brain Tumor MRI datasets available on Kaggle

Data type: MRI brain scan images

Classes:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

Notes:

- A subset of the dataset was used for training and evaluation.
- Images were resized and normalized before training.
- Basic data augmentation was applied to improve generalization.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to automate brain tumor detection from MRI images using deep learning techniques.  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify MRI images as either **tumor** or **non-tumor**.  

The dataset was preprocessed to ensure better performance through normalization, augmentation, and resizing.

## 🧩 Features
- 🧠 Automatic detection of tumors from MRI scans  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and augmentation for accuracy improvement  
- 📊 Model evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy metrics  
- 💾 Model saved for reuse and future deployment
